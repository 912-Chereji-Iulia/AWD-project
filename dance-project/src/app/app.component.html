  <div id="etymology" class="section">
    <h2>Etymology of the Word "Dance"</h2>
    <p>
      The word "dance" has its origins in the Middle English word <strong>dans</strong>, which comes from the Old French <strong>dancer</strong>, meaning "to stretch out" or "to move lightly." The root of these words can be traced to the Latin word <em>daps</em>, meaning "a feast" or "celebration," suggesting that dance was originally part of ceremonial feasts and rituals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, the meaning expanded to include any rhythmic movement to music, evolving across different cultures and languages.

      Dance is believed to be one of the oldest art forms. Evidence of early dance dates back to prehistory, with ancient civilizations like the Egyptians, Greeks, and Indians incorporating dance into rituals and performances. The first known depictions of dancing in human culture appear in cave paintings dating back over 9,000 years.
